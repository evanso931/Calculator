Embedded C Calculator on the TM4C LaunchPad

I developed code to interface the Tiva LaunchPad with a keypad and LCD to make a calculator. It can execute floating-point calculations and perform multiple operand calculations with correct operator precedence. The calculator circuit was first simulated in TINA-v12 to test the code, then it was deployed to the hardware using the Keil IDE and the logic analyser was used to check timing.
